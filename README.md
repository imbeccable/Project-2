Art 151 Project 2: a text-based game

This is based on the school yard paper fortune teller. It's also been called Chatterbox, which is what I've named my game.

What you do is you will input one of four colors, a number, and then choose another color depending on where your game has landed you.
Instead of fortunes, you will be given guided advice based on what you've inputed. Assuming you don't choose the same thing every time,
you'll get a new answer at the end of each round you play!
